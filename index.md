CHAPTER 1: NEGATIVE

You wake up in the morning to the sound of OBNOXIOUS FUCKING BIRDS.

GOD DAMN IT, YOU STUPID AVIANS.

You just woke up and you already feel horrible, you don't even have the energy to get off your awful air mattress to go get your iced coffee that you bought yesterday out of the fridge.
This is bad.
Is this the definition of bad?
Does Bruno Mars is Gay?
Please do tell.

Atleast your phone is on the nightstand, you reach over to grab it.
You then turn it on.

The battery is at 1%.
Who keeps fucking unplugging this thing while it's charging.
Oh, right, that would be you, waking up in the middle of the night to furiously masturbate.
Moving on, THIS IS A POSITIVE ENVIROMENT, WE DO NOT NEED SELF-HATRED HERE.

After getting your eyes bleached by the screen of your phone, you somehow obtain the energy required to get out of bed.

You gracefully walk down the stairs and then fall down them like a very intelligent being.
Bravo.

After recovering from your near-fatal mishap, you crawl to the kitchen and open up the fridge to get your iced coffee.

As you open the bottle of your sweet, cold beverage, you reflect on how fucking shitty this day has been.

As you're about to drink some of your coffee, you somehow miss your fucking mouth with the bottle and end up spilling it all over yourself.
NICE
SICK
RAD
COOL
FUCKING GARBAGE.

You take off the sweater you were wearing, and go back upstairs and back to sleep.
just what the fuck even

CHAPTER 2: THOSE MOTHERFUCKING ABS.

After the shitty day that was yesterday, you wake up to find yourself in a box.
It's an empty white box-shaped room, with spongy floors and walls.

Where the fuck am I.

There's a single, metal door. you try knocking on the door.
No response.

You then try headbutting the door.
It's made out of solid metal are you fucking retarded????

Now that your head is bleeding, you try something 'CONSIDERABLY' more safe after 10 minutes of thinking.

You drop-kick the fucking door because why???
The solid-metal door flings right open as you fall onto the spongy floor, you aren't complaining, although you did fall on your arse.

You get up and exit through the door, where you are greeted with 2 hallways made out of the same STRANGE SPONGY SUBSTANCE.
wait why the fuck did you just call it that.

Anyway, you choose the left one which is a dead-end, you then go to the right and you find a door at the end of the hall.

The door won't open, you sit on the floor and think about what you do next.
Oh, maybe there was something in the original-oh wait the door fucking closed itself.
great.

You knock on the door.
nothing, why would you even think that would work???

You drop-kick the door.
The door shoots you into the other hallway, resulting in many broken bones. Nice!

You are suffering from internal bleeding, is this what being 'dead inside' feels like, you wonder.

And you're dead.
Fuck.

Later, you regain consciousness?
You are blinded by a white light, but after adapting to the awful lighting of this place you realize you're in heaven and in-front of you is motherfuckin' JESUS, GOD DAMN CHRIST.
WHAT THE FUCK HE'S SWOLE

You ask him one simple question, 'What is the meaning of life?', to which he replies, 'boy i've been asked this shit so many fucking times i don't have the time for this.'
He then directs you to the door to leave HEAVEN.
why is heaven in capitals

As you leave heaven through the holy gate, you realize that you're fALLING FROM THE FUCKING SKY HOLY SHIT

Unsurprisingly, you die, again.

And you're greeted by Jesus, again.

You tell him to fucking kill himself as he looks at you with a shit-eating grin.
You then kick him right in the babymaker.

Then you wake up and realize that this is the most fucking dumb dream you've ever had.
You then realize that you're HARD AS FUCK because of Jesus' abs.
fucking gay.

CHAPTER 3: STARVATION

After that clusterfuck of a dream that you just had, you 

decide to go downstair-WAIT.
YOUR MOTHER IS HOME.

YOU CANNOT GO INTO THE LIVING ROOM WITH A 

ROCK-HARD COCK WHILE YOUR MOTHER IS AWAKE.
SHIT.

Now you just have no idea what to do.
You consider just staying in your room and doing jackshit 

on your computer, maybe troll a few fucks on some 

forums for some games, and call it a day.

But what is a computer session without SNACKS.

YOU REQUIRE CHIPS.
YOU CANNOT GO GET CHIPS.
THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT.

Will you just starve up here, because of your sweet wet-

dream about Jesus' sexy abs?
This is the WORST.

You do have a blowgun under the bed, but that's 

ridiculous. Knocking your own mother unconscious because 

you have a hard dick.

You resort to just camping in your room, fucking around 

on your computer.

You find a new game to play called 'Individual's Known 

War-Grounds', it looks fucking stupid but it's not like 

you have anything else to do.

You waste about 4 hours on it, and, unsurprisingly, it was 

the worst game you've ever played in your life.
You also had some guy call you a racial slur over voice 

chat, great community too.

But, as you look downwards, you realize that your PENIS 

IS STILL AS HARD AS A FUCKING ASTROID.
HOLY SHIT
THOSE GOD DAMN ABS MAN.

As you rage at your penis, you hear the noise of a car 

outside.
Can you finally get your fucking chips???

You slowly sneak downstairs, and peek into the kitchen.
Noone's home, YES.

You sprint to the cabinet and grab your chips.
JIMBO MOTHERFUCKIN' EXAFAN WINS AGAIN 

FUCKERS.

Your mother then walks into the kitchen and you get 

caught with a rock-hard boner, needless to say, it was 

awkward to explain.

But the car??????????
Oh wait, that was your father.

CHAPTER 4: SERVICE COST

After explaining your erection, you go back to your room and back to sleep, Slowly dying from embarassment.

You wake up to..
an odd liquid substance leaking from your ceiling...?????????

Oh, it's oil.
You can tell from the awful-yet-slightly-good-smelling stench that it radiates.
BUT WHY IS FUCKING OIL LEAKING FROM YOUR ROOF?

You rush downstairs and go outside to see what is causing this inconvenience.

HOW IN THE ACTUAL FUCK DID YOUR DAD GET THE CAR STUCK *IN* YOUR ROOF.
WHAT

Well, needless to say, this is fucking bothersome.
You grab your homemade BLOWGUN from under the bed and shoot a DART at the TIRE.
WHY SO MANY CAPITALS.

You manage to pop the tire but it did jackshit. Nice.

You pick up your couch which is in-front of your shelf of consol-wait you're like fucking 7 how did you pick up a couch.
The couch squishes you.
FUCK.

After limping out from beneath the disgusting fucking couch, full of crumbs of chips and other disgusting garbage, You decide to just use your phone and call a service to remove the car from your roof.
BUT YOU DID NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION HOW MUCH FUCKING MONEY THIS WOULD COST.

This costed a hefty 1,500$, Since the service that you called is on the other fucking side of town, and moving a giant crane from one side of town all the way to the other is time consuming.
Nice one, jackass.

Needless to say, your father was not amused.
